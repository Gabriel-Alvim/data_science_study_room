# The Data Science Study Room

I've created this little project to help me keep organized and on track of my personal studies.
While I won't be subimmting any top grade code here, I will be trying to keep some examples per topic. Most of it will be in Python, but maybe I'll do some in R later on.
I'll also be linking free books and guides on many different topics.

## Packages I might be using

### Python

* Pandas (data manipulation and data viz)
* Numpy (data manipulation but work on array/matrices logic)
* Matplotlib (specially pyplot for data viz and plotting)
* Scipy (super useful mathematics package)
* Scikit-learn (the go to machine learning lib)
* Shogun (also super great machine learning lib)
* Seaborn (also really good data viz lib but with more tools for data analysis)
* Pyplot (interactive data viz, great for making apps or plugging it on pages and blogs)
* Xgboost (only use it after you are comfortable with machine learning)

### R

* carets (best ML package for R)
* glm (good slection of generalized linear models)
* ggplot2 (data viz)
* Pyplot
* forecast (for forecasts duh)
* Shiny R (if you want to make small apps)
* foreign (so you can open different data formats)


## List of Topics I want to go through (not in this particular order)

### Data Mining and Working with Non-Numerical Data

* Plotting and Data Viz
* Converting categorical data to numeric
* Working with text
* Working with dates
* Feature Selection

### Statistics

* Paramater Estimation
* Hypothesis Testing
* Linear Models, Polynomial Models and Segmented Models
* Generalized Linear Models
* Sampling and weighting
* Principal Component Analysis and Factorial Analysis

### Machine Learning

* Cross Validation
* Supervised Learning
* Decision Trees, Ensembles, Boosting and Bagging
* Support Vector Machines
* Recursive Learning
* Unsupervised Learning
* Clustering
* Ranking

### Deep Learning

* Neural Nets
* Gradient Descent
